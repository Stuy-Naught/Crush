    <h1> congratulations!</h1>
    <p> You have successfully submitted your crushes. 
      {% if num_left > 0 %}
        You still have <b>{{ num_left }}</b> crushes left &mdash; feel free to come back and <a href="http://crush.mit.edu/">submit more!</a>
      {% endif %}
    </p> 

    <p>Here are the crushes you submitted:
      <ul>
	{% for crush in crushees %}
	  <li>{{ crush.name }} - {{ crush.email }}</li>
	{% endfor %}
      </ul>
    </p>

    <p> If one of your crushes has already submitted a crush on you, you should both receive an email very shortly. If not, you'll just have to sit tight until one of them submits a crush on you. Want to increase the chance of this happening? Then 
<script>function fbs_click() {u="http://crush.mit.edu";t="MIT Crush";window.open('http://www.facebook.com/sharer.php?u='+encodeURIComponent(u)+'&t='+encodeURIComponent(t),'sharer','toolbar=0,status=0,width=626,height=436');return false;}</script><a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.facebook.com/share.php?u=<;url>" onclick="return fbs_click()" target="_blank">spread the word</a>
 about MIT Crush.</p>

    <p> You're allowed to submit new crushes every two weeks, so come back on <b>{{ refresh_date }}</b> and send in more!</p>
